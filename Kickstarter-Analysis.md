## Overview of Project
   Preform analysis on current cite data to gain an understanding of kickstarters and what aspects make them successful from their creation to the completetion 

### Purpose
    This project is intened to help Lousie determine the neccessary requirements needed to be succcessful with her up and coming playwrite "Fever".

## Analysis and Challenges
    Over all Lousies should be able to be successful in her attempt to put on the play "Fever". As long as she prices her play to be around $5000 to $14000 dollars and plans to start it in the kickstarter in the months between May and June. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    When looking at the Outcomes Based on Launch Date numbers graph below; Lousie is most successful with her kickstarters in the middle of the year. The beginning of the year and the end of the year she has almost the same number of failed kickstarters as successful ones. The total number of successful kickstarter plays is greater than the total number of kickstarters canceled or failed. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

https://github.com/MatthewMcCoston/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/master/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png

    When looking at the Outcomes Based on Goal numbers graphed below; Lousie has the most success with goals for a play when her goal is less than $5000. Success is more likely when the goals are between $5000 to $14,999  and $35,000 to $44,999. When her goal is between $15,000 and $19,999 success equally as likely as failure. However, if her goal is above $25,000 to $34,000 she is more likely to fail; even more so when her goal is anywhere about $45,000.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    Some of the Challenges that I encountered quite frequently was making sure I selected the correct data to go into my functions. I had to double check a lot of my work because Fortunately and unfortuantely the functions will process what you enter into them. So while my work was outputting data the data it was outputting was to different questions. Another difficulty I encounter was making sure I enters the functions in correctly. For example with the =countifs section of the homework, I struggled at first because I was leaving the s off of countifs which changed the amount of arguemtents I could make to the equation. 

## Results
    What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date are that people tend to back play kickstarters during the months in the middle of the year and people are least likely to to back a play kicksters during the months of January and December.People are more likely to be successful with their play kickstarters if they keep the amount needed for the Goal under Under under $5000 dollars.

Some of the limitation of this dataset are:
    The data presented here comes from one source of kickstarters and does not include other kickstarters data sets, which then makes the amount of accuarcy skewed.
    The data present also doesnt include the insentives of the backers which then could bring up the question of was the money purely give to start the kickstarters or were there insentives like free meal at this restaurant if you donate to support this kickstarter


Other possible tables and/or graphs that coule be created are 
    -Comparing Backers to Average Donation to see if is due to high donations or high backers that the kickstarter was successful
    -Comparing the Date of Creation to Date of Deadline vs Success to Fail rate to see how long a kickstarter needs to be active roughly before it is likely to succeed.
